# Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing and processing data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook (`main.ipynb`) includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and model training steps. It is designed to help users understand key insights and make predictions based on the dataset.

## Installation

### For Windows
1. Open Command Prompt and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. If you don't have Jupyter installed, install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

### For macOS
1. Open Terminal and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. If Jupyter is not installed, install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run `main.ipynb` step by step to execute the analysis.

## Dataset

- The project uses a dataset for analysis and model training.
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory before running the notebook.

## Output

- The notebook provides data visualizations and predictions based on the dataset.
- Results may include charts, graphs, and model performance metrics.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to contributors and libraries used in the project.
